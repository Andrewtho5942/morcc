# morcc
A simple morse code translator for C. Some translations had to be created for characters that were not defined in the international morse code standard. Therefore, if the morse code generated by this translator has undefined characters, this means that the character is one of the following characters: '#', '%', '*', '<', '>', '[', '\', ']', '^', '`', '{', '|', '}', '~', or '\t'.
